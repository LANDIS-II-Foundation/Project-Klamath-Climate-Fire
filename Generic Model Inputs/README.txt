The current file configuration is for no management under contemporary climate.  In order to run any of the variants, drag in all the files from one management variant and one (or none) climate change variant at a time.  Once the appropriate files are in place, the Scenario.txt and centure-succession-base_v17.txt files need to be edited to match the new file names.  You must also convert the RunIt.txt file to a batch (.bat) file extension.
